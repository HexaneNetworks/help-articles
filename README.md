# Help

Official Help Articles for the Hexane Networks Knowledge Base.

[help.hexanenetworks.com](https://help.hexanenetworks.com)

# Why are these here?

We use GitHub as a way to allow our team to contribute easily and version control efficiency. 

# What does this do?

We write our articles and push them to this repository, which are then cloned automatically onto our Node.js server which is the core for our [help site](https://help.hexanenetworks.com). This is an efficient process and allows us to work faster. Multiple people can be working at once without overlapping too.


# What can I do with this? 

You are free to use these as a guide to follow. We do allow you to use these on your projects, however, you must **state the source** of were they where from originally (link to this repository).

# What's this file format?

We use a popular text formatting syntax known as [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). This allows anyone contributing to add formatting to their articles. Click [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) to view a "cheatsheet" of a handful of the markdown syntaxes.

# How do I contribute to this?

We're currently not looking for additional authors, however, we may be soon if you show you're interested :)
