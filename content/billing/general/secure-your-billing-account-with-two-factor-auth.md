Two-Factor Authentication is an additional method of security to confirm your identity when logging into your account. This means if anyone was to know your credentials (email, password), your account would be safe as the second layer of authentication would be required and only you as the genuine account owner would have that information in the form of a time-based token generated by your mobile phone.

Enabling Two-Factor Authentication on your Billing account:

1. Click [here](https://billing.hexanenetworks.com/clientarea.php?action=security) to navigate to the security page of your account of the billing area. Login if prompted.
2. Proceed to click the button to enable 2FA.
