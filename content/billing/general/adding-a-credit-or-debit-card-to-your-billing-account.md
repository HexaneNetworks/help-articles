If you wish to use a credit / debit card to pay for your services, you'll need to link one to your billing account first. On the same page, you can also remove any existing cards if necessary. A linked card will automatically be charged on the renewal/due date of the service/invoice if initially chosen as the default payment method upon ordering.
