If you ordered via the Credit/Debit Card option at checkout, you would've added a card to your account for the system to use. Your card will automatically be charged every time your service is set to renew. For example, if you choose a monthly billing cycle and ordered on the 4th of the month, each month, on the 4th day your card will be charged. This is a benefit to most people as you don't need to worry about manually logging in and paying like you would normally do with PayPal. On the topic of PayPal, you can also setup an automatic payment if you wish. Simply head over to an unpaid invoice and click *Subscribe*.

Feel free to contact us if you have any further questions.
