It's common now and then for PayPal to hold a payment you made to us for manual review. These are conducted by PayPal on their side and we can't speed up nor control the outcome of one of these manual checks. These are put in place by PayPal to prevent fraud primarily and happen more often on new, unverified PayPal accounts.

#### How do I know if a payment has been held?
PayPal doesn't tell you as the buyer, they only tell us. A clear indicator would be if your invoice is marked as unpaid after you've paid and have waited a few minutes.

#### How long does the hold last?
It takes PayPal up to 24 hours to review the payment.

#### Will the payment be cancelled?
9 out of 10 they're accepted and go through as normal. In the rare case it doesn't, you'd be refunded.
