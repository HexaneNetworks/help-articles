#### Why does this happen?
This happens when you attempt to use Paypal's subscribe feature without having any form of bank, credit card or debit card added to your Paypal account.

#### How can I pay without a bank, credit card or debit card being added to my account?
In the invoice, simply click **Paypal Checkout** instead of **Paypal Subscribe**. As a result of this you will have to pay invoices manually, invoices will be generated prior to the due date, you can pay invoices in the **Invoices** tab in the client area.
