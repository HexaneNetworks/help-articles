#### Can I upload my own .dll files?
Unfortunately we **do not** allow users to upload DLL files, **we value our users security and privacy**, therefore we don't allow it for security purposes. 

**Please check the Mod Manager for the .dll file you wish to use as we may already have it on our 1 click installer already.**

#### Can I have my ones uploaded?
**Most likely.** Feel free to contact us and we will happily review your custom .dll files to be uploaded either to the Mod Manager or your personal server directly.
