#### What is debugging?
Debugging is to identify and remove errors from code. In this context - you're going to learn how to correct errors in job code.

#### Common errors that indicate an error in a DarkRP job
``The player's name is <name>, their team number is "1001", which has the name "Unassigned"``  
``[ERROR] gamemodes/darkrp/gamemode/modules/base/sv_gamemode_functions.lua:740: attempt to index local 'jobTable' (a nil value)``

These errors may appear in the web console or in the in-game console. It's advised you check both.

#### How can I debug a DarkRP job?
FPtje has kindly provided an online Lua script checker. This will provide you with more accurate errors in the job code - allowing you to make a more focused attempt at correcting the errors. This can be accessed here: [Script Checker](https://fptje.github.io/glualint-web/)

If you're struggling to debug the job using the FPtje's Script Checker then it is advised that you remove the job that is causing the error and recreate it using: [cSite's Job Generator](https://csite.io/tools/gmod-darkrp-job)

Please refer to our this article for help with recreating the job: [Adding Jobs In DarkRP](https://help.hexanenetworks.com/game-servers/garrys-mod/adding-jobs-in-darkrp)
