#### Why is this useful?
This allows people who run networks with multiple servers to copy across ranks quickly and seamlessly with no differences in rank names and/or permissions.

#### I'm not seeing ULib data in the data folder!
This is because you either haven't installed ULib and ULX or you haven't rebooted your server since installing ULib and ULX.
