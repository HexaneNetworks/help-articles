#### What is the console?
The console is an interface that allows you to run commands on your client.

#### Method
1. Launch *Garry's Mod**.
2. Click on the **Options** button.
3. Click on the **Advanced** button.
4. Tick the **Enable developer console** box.
5. Click on the **Ok** button.
6. Click on the **Apply** button.
7. By default the key to open the console is the key underneath your ``Esc`` key. If this is not the case, open the options again and navigate to the keyboard tab, then proceed to scroll to the bottom and check what key is assigned for you.
8. In order to connect to your server, input ``connect ip`` into the console, replace **ip** with your servers IP address, for example: ``connect 51.38.94.0:27185``.
9. If you have a password on the server you are connecting with, input ``connect ip; password 123``. Replace **ip** with your servers IP address and replace **123** with your servers password. For example: ``connect 51.38.94.0:27185; password HexaneNetworks``.
