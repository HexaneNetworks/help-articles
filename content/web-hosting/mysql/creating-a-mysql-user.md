3. Scroll down to the **Add New user** subsection underneath **MySQL Users**.
4. In the **Username** field input a unique username for the user. Similarly to database creating, the username you input will always start with your **CPanel username** followed by an underscore.
5. In the **Password** field, input a unique password for the user. Ensure this password is **strong** for maximum security, you can do this by referring to the strength indicator at the bottom of the form.
6. In the **Password (Again)** field simply input the password you created once again.
7. Click **Create User**.
