#### What is a domain name?

A domain name is the identification string to access a website, you will often see a domain name in the URL box of your browser. For example, you're on our help page which shows as https://help.hexanenetworks.com in your browser url box. This means that our domain is `hexanenetworks.com`

#### Do I need a domain name to use the web hosting?
Yes, you will need a live domain name you own, to use our web hosting. You can purchase a domain from sites such as [GoDaddy](https://uk.godaddy.com) or [NameCheap](https://www.namecheap.com). We recommend a `.com` domain. You pay yearly for a domain which works out to be affordable for most people (prices start at around £10).
