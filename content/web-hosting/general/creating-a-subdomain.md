#### What is a Subdomain?
A subdomain is a domain that is a part of your primary domain. An example of this is ``cpanel.hexanenetworks.com``.
Changing a subdomain would change ``hexanenetworks.com/cpanel`` to ``cpanel.hexanenetworks.com``.

#### Method
1. Login to [CPanel](https://cpanel.hexanenetworks.com) by doing one of the following: using the login information provided in the **Web Hosting Information** email or using the CPanel shortcut in the [Billing Area](https://billing.hexanenetworks.com/)
2. Once you are in CPanel search for **Subdomains** in the search bar and click on the appropriate result.
3. In the **Subdomain** field input your desired domain prefix, for example: ``cpanel``.
4. In the **Domain** drop down menu select the domain you wish to add the subdomain to.
5. In the **Document Root** field input the location of the page you want the subdomain to link to, for example ``/public_html/cpanel/``.
