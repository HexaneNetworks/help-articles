#### Do I need a domain name to use the web hosting?
Yes, you will need a live domain name you own, to use our web hosting. You can purchace a domain from sites such as [GoDaddy](https://uk.godaddy.com) or [NameCheap](https://www.namecheap.com). We reccommend a `.com` domain. You pay yearly for a domain which works out to be affordable for most people (prices start at around Â£10).
