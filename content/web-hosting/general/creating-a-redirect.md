#### What are redirects?
When you navigate to a redirected webpage it will transfer you to either a different location in that website or an entirely different website.

#### Caching
If you've added a redirect and it doesn't appear to be working, please clear your web browsers cache.
If you have removed a redirect and it is still redirecting, please clear your web browsers cache.

#### Method
1. Login to [cPanel](https://cpanel.hexaneweb.com) by doing one of the following: using the login information provided in the **Web Hosting Information** email or using the CPanel shortcut in the [Billing Area](https://billing.hexanenetworks.com/)
2. Once you are in cPanel search for **Redirects** and proceed to click on the appropriate result.
3. In the **Type** field choose whether you would like a permanent or a temporary redirect. A temporary redirect will not update the users bookmarks.
4. In the **https?://(www.)?** field select the domain or subdomain you would like to redirect from.
5. In the **/** field input the filepath you would like to redirect from.
6. In the **Redirects to** field input where you would like to redirect the user to.
7. Finally in the **www. redirection:** field, select the applicable choice. If you're unsure, leave it as the default option.
8. Proceed to click **Add**.

#### Example

This for example, would redirect users attempting to access ``https://hexanenetworks.com/example`` to ``https://www.google.com``.
