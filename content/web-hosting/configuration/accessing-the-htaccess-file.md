#### Why can't I see this file?
By default cPanel disables the viewing of **dotfiles**, this includes all files beginning with a ``.``, such as: ``.env`` and ``.htaccess``.

#### Method
1. Login to [CPanel](https://cpanel.hexaneweb.com) by doing one of the following: using the login information provided in the **Web Hosting Information** email or using the CPanel shortcut in the [Billing Area](https://billing.hexanenetworks.com/)
2. Once you are in CPanel search for **File Manager** in the search bar and click on the appropriate result.
3. In the top right of the **File Manager** click on the **Settings** button. 
4. Proceed to tick the **Show Hidden Files** option and click the **Save** button in the bottom right of the **Settings** box.
5. Navigate to the ``public_html`` directory.
6. Click on the ``.htaccess`` file and click on the **Edit** button in the top navigation bar.
