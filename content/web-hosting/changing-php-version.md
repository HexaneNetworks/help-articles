#### What does changing the PHP version allow you to do?
Changing the PHP version allows you to specify PHP version for the root domain or any sub-domains, doing this allows you to run PHP applications that require an older or a newer PHP version. PHP 5.6 and PHP 7 are the most commonly used - these are listed as **ea-php56** or **ea-php70** in the MultiPHP Manager. 

#### How to change the PHP version of your website
