#### What does changing your timezone do?
Changing your timezone changes the timezone that our gamepanel uses when listing any times for you. This impacts the times on scheduled restarts for example.

#### Method (Game Panel)
1. Navigate to the [Game Panel](https://gamepanel.hexanenetworks.com) and 
proceed to login.
2. Click on **Game Services** button and if prompted select the server you would like to change the name of.
3. Click on the **My Profile** button.
4. Navigate to the **Time Zone** drop down.

6. Click the **Save** button in the navigation bar, allow the saving process to finish and your timezone will have successfully been updated.
