Once the invoice affiliated to the service is marked as paid, our system will begin to set up your server automatically. This usually takes around 1-3 minutes. You will receive your server's information via email. 

In rare cases, setup may fail. If you don't receive your login information (remember to check the spam folder) after 10 minutes, please [contact us](https://billing.hexanenetworks.com/submitticket.php) and we will resolve it promptly.
