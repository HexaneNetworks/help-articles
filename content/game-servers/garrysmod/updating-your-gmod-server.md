## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
<br>
#### Why would I need to update my server?
Garry's Mod is frequently updated with new features, bug fixes and performance changes. Therefore, updating your server is **required** when a new version of the game is released.

<br>

#### What happens if I don't update my server?
Upon a new Garry's Mod update release, you need to update your local game and game server else you will not be able to join the server. 

**Message(s) displayed upon joining the server when the client or server isn't updated**

> "Server is running an older version of the game"

or

> "Server is running an newer version of the game"

<br>
Both these messages will prevent you to join the server until you update the server or your local game.

<br>

#### Will updating the server break anything?
Most of the time, **no**. However, rarely Garry's Mod updates do in fact break addons due to changes in the game's code. We suggest contacting the developer if you do encounter a broken addon after an update.
