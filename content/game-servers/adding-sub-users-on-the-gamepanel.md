#### What are Sub-Users?
Sub-Users are users that you, as the person paying for the product, can control. You are given an array of permissions you can give them, such as access to the gamepanel for that service.

Any damage caused by a sub-user is your responsibility, it's highly advised you don't give sub-users to people unless you can put your full trust in them.
