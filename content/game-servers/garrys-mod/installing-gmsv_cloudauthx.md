#### What is it and what does it do?
The gmsv_cloudauthx module is a dll that allows Clockwork gamemodes to run correctly. Currently we don't allow the installation of DLL files manually for security reasons, so this is the only way for the gmsv_cloudauthx module to be installed. If there are any errors when installing or the gmsv_cloudauthx module we provide is out of date please contact us in a ticket and we will resolve this as soon as possible.
