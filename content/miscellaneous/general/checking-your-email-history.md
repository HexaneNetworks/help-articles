#### What is the "Email History"?
Our billing area provides a page to view emails that have been sent out to the email linked to your billing area account. This is useful if you've had to change the email linked to your billing area account and need to view emails sent out to your previous email address. Email history does not contain the emails that provide gameserver information (e.g Garry's Mod Server Information emails) information - that can be found in our game panel, in the **Email Notifications** tab.
